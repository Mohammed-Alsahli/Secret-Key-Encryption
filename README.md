Introduction
So far in this course, you’ve seen many cryptosystems, learned how they work,
and how they may be broken. We discussed symmetric and asymmetric
cryptography and how the keys are generated and used to encrypt and decrypt
messages.
For this course’s project, we’ll take a closer look at Secret-Key Encryption. This
project will help you gain You’ll gain first-hand experience on encryption
algorithms, encryption modes, paddings, and initial vector (IV). Moreover,
students will be able to use tools and write programs to encrypt/decrypt
messages. This lab was created by Seed Labs, which is a project led by Professor
Wenliang Du, with many of his students working on these labs and environments.
This lab covers the following topics:
• Secret-key encryption
• Substitution cipher and frequency analysis
• Encryption modes, IV, and paddings
• Common mistakes in using encryption
• Programming using the crypto library
